This is an L-System that takes the user's mood as input and they can also set the angle and iteration count which then will generate patterns based on it.

To try out the system, first run all the code up until the My System tab to define all the functions needed to run it.
Then, you can take a look at the sample output from the Sample Output tab to see the difference between parameters will create.
At the very last of the page, there will be a User Test tab that where users will be able to try it themselves.
